# YouTube ReVanced Magisk Module

<sub>(unaffiliated what-so-ever)<sub>

This repo includes a simple script that
downloads all the latest version of necessary prebuilt revanced tools and the stock YouTube APK from APKMirror and creates a magisk module  

You will need to install the stock YouTube app matching with the module version on your phone using [SAI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aefyr.sai&hl=tr&gl=US) with the split APKs  
You can go grab the split APKs from APKMirror (the bundle, not the apk or it will crash)  


You can get the [latest CI release](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module/releases) if you do not wish to build yourself.


# Building the Magisk Module

```bash
$ ./build.sh all
```
